# Technical-Documentation-Page
This is another project that I have been working as practice, a technical documentation page for AJAX.
The main practice for this project was CSS with the positioning of elements( fixed, relative, absolute)
as well as media queries for displaying a certain layout according to screen size.
Something new that I learned from here was the <code> tag and how to style pieces of code in the page.
Something that I would improve and definitely have to keep working on is the alignment of elements and accessibility of the webpage for screen readers.
